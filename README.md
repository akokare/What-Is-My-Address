# What-Is-My-IP-Address
Simple tool to geolocate IP address based on user input

For this script, we will be using a bunch of Python modules to accomplish this.

First we make a check to see that the user puts in enough arguments, and if not, they 'usage' variable will be printed on how to use it.

We are using the <a href="ip-tracker.org/">ip-tracker</a> web service to geolocate the IP.
